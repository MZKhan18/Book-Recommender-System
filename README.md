# Book Recommender System

This is a Book Recommender System web application, with a focus on demonstrating data science technologies and techniques. The system is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications, and showcases collaborative filtering for book recommendations. The project emphasizes data science skills, including data preprocessing, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis.

## Data Science Skills

As a data science student, I have leveraged various data science technologies and methodologies to develop this project:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The book dataset underwent thorough preprocessing to handle missing values, clean the data, and convert it into a suitable format for analysis.

- **Collaborative Filtering:** The heart of the system lies in collaborative filtering, a popular technique used in recommendation systems to find similarities between books and make personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

- **Machine Learning Models:** I have experimented with multiple machine learning models, such as similarity measures, to determine which books are most similar to the user-selected book.

- **Data Visualization:** The project includes data visualizations using Streamlit to present the recommendations and book information in an engaging and user-friendly manner.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Prior to building the recommender system, I performed EDA to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distribution of book attributes, and identify any patterns or trends.

## Web Development Skills

In addition to data science technologies, I have utilized web development skills to create the user interface and deploy the web application:

- **Streamlit:** I used Streamlit, a powerful web app framework, to build the interactive user interface and display book recommendations in real-time.

- **HTML/CSS:** While the primary focus is on data science, I applied basic HTML/CSS knowledge to customize the appearance of the web application and enhance the user experience.

## Getting Started

To try the Book Recommender System web application locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can use the `requirements.txt` file to install the necessary packages.
3. Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Access the web application in your web browser by visiting [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## How to Use

1. Select a book from the dropdown list that you are interested in exploring.
2. Click on the "Recommend" button to receive recommendations for similar books.
3. The system will display the top five similar books along with their authors, ratings, and votes. If an image is available, the book's thumbnail will also be shown.
